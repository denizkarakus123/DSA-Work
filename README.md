# Data Structures and Algorithms (Winter 2025)
This repository contains my implementations for the three programming assignments in COMP 251 at McGill University.

## Assignment 1 – Foundations of Data Structures

### Q1 – Hash Tables (Chaining & Open Addressing)
Implemented hash tables using multiplication and linear probing methods; supported insertKey, removeKey, and collision counting.

### Q2A – Union-Find (Disjoint Set Part A)
Built a disjoint-set forest with union-by-rank and path-compression to efficiently merge and query connected components.

### Q2B – Extended Disjoint Set (Part B)
Enhanced Union-Find to support dynamic element movement (move) and aggregate operations (sum_elements).

### Q3 – Discussion Board Analysis (Real-World Problem)
Processed user posts to identify common keywords shared by all users, ranked by frequency and lexicographic order.

## Assignment 2 – Algorithmic Paradigms

### Q1 – Complete Search (Board Game Solver)
Designed a recursive search to minimize remaining balls and moves in a peg-solitaire-style board game.

### Q2 – Divide and Conquer (Swap Counting)
Used merge-sort-based inversion counting to compute the minimal number of adjacent swaps needed to sort a queue.

### Q3 – Dynamic Programming (Staircase Training)
Formulated a DP algorithm to assign up/down stair steps minimizing maximum elevation while ending at the base level.

### Q4 – Greedy Scheduling (Homework Planner)
Applied a greedy strategy with deadline- and weight-based sorting to maximize total homework value completed on time.

## Assignment 3 – Graph Algorithms and Network Flows

### Q1 – Sensitive Species Protection (Graph Traversal)
Simulated frog movement over a grid with barriers to compute the minimal number of frogs required and unreachable food nodes.

### Q2 – Airline Network (Reachability Analysis)
Modeled city connections as a directed graph to determine for each airport whether continuous travel is possible (succeed / failed).

### Q3 – Optimal Wire Length (Minimum Spanning Tree)
Computed the minimal total wire length connecting all circuit nodes using Euclidean distances and MST principles.

### Q4 – Flow Network (Ford-Fulkerson Algorithm)
Implemented DFS-based path search and full Ford-Fulkerson max-flow computation for weighted directed graphs.
